# SimuEngine
## What is SimuEngine?
It is a simulation engine that plans to have the following features:
* Fully functioning IDE
* Powerful development and simulation tools
* Games, plugins and modifications
* Time, physics, weather, climate etc.
* Server hosting and multiplayer
* Third party integrations and support
* Applicaitons and game publications
* And even more...!
## But how are you going to add so much?
We don't. Well we will in slow updates. The Exousia Partnership (the project organiser and leader) is still developing and will be active (in the very far future) and when it does it will hopefully speed up development across the board.
